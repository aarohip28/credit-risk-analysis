# 💳 Credit Risk Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting credit risk using customer financial data. It applies supervised machine learning techniques to classify loan applicants as high or low risk.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not.
- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key risk indicators
- Feature encoding and transformation
- Logistic Regression for binary classification
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes attributes like:
- Credit score
- Income
- Loan amount
- Age, employment history, and more

> Note: Use a sample credit risk dataset from Kaggle or UCI repository for testing.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualization of confusion matrix and probability distributions

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Experiment with decision trees, random forest, or XGBoost
- Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Add real-time prediction interface or dashboard
